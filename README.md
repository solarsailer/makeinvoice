## Requirements

* github.com/codegangsta/cli
* github.com/fatih/color

## TODO

[] Handle CSS file.
[] Support XLS document.
[] Currently, we only import one CSV in one part of a document (`.Table`). Should be better to have multiple export points.
[] Better template system (`{{Â .Table }}` is not pretty).
[] Vendor Go libraries.
